## Tracking App

Personnal project part of the Frontend Module in SDA8, Novare Potential.

### Task:
*Create a simple web app for our customers that displays a list of orders (or parcels) with some details they need to know like order status, ETAs, pickup locations, etc.*
     
*Feel free to have UI/UX that best fits the use-case.*

*API Endpoint:* https://my.api.mockaroo.com/orders.json?key=e49e6840

*The app MUST be done using ReactJS and support major mobile & desktop
browsers/layouts.*

### Personnal interpretation
In order to make sense regarding the data used to build the app, when you open the app, **you are a third-party freelance**, responsible for several clients orders.
     
Those customers made you responsible of the ordering/delivering process and you are using this application to track all orders in one single place.
